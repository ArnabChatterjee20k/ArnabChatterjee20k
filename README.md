Building, breaking, fixing two tools at a time 🛠️ | Developer | Builder | Learner

I’m a passionate developer who loves turning ideas into tools — sometimes useful, sometimes weirdly fun, always educational. From pub-sub experiments using GitHub issues to palette generators for designers, I enjoy solving problems with clean, functional code and shipping fast.

I like working across the stack, experimenting with microservices, real-time systems, developer tools, and quirky product ideas. If there's a hackathon or a late-night "what-if" idea, I’m probably on it. Always chasing the next "aha!" moment.

🧠 Self-starter & lifelong learner
